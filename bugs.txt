1) Like the negative terrain indexing bug, paints terrain around the top part of the screen. I haven't been able to reproduce it but it happened when all sprites were shooting at the ceiling.

*2) Soldier shooting, and tank shooting, can cause a blast inside the terrain. I need to add a line cast with slope etc. to step back through the bullet's path and find the first thing it hit. This should work regardless of how fast the bullet is moving aka how far it moves each step.

3) Soldier and Tank need more animations.

4) SEGFAULT happens when a sprite goes offscreen
